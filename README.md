# Data-Science-Trainer-Assignment

This repository contains my solution to the Data Science Trainer Assignment. The assignment involved analyzing a dataset containing the statements and reasons given by members of different teams on a given topic. The goal was to identify the top teams and top performers based on the number of statements and reasons they provided.

The repository contains the following files:
Data Science Trainer Assignment.xlsx: the original dataset used for analysis
Cleaned Data.xlsx a cleaned version of the dataset after removing any duplicate entries and erroneous data
Data Science Trainer Assignment.ipynb: a Jupyter notebook containing the Python code used to analyze the data and generate the results
Leaderboard TeamWise (Output).csv: the top teams based on the number of statements and reasons they provided
Leaderboard Individual (Output).csv : the top performers based on the number of statements and reasons they provided
README.md: this file
Feel free to clone this repository and run the Jupyter notebook to reproduce the analysis or modify it for your own use. If you have any questions or comments, feel free to reach out to me.
